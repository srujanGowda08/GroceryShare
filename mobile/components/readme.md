# Components

This directory contains React Native components for the GroceryShare mobile application.

## Guidelines

1. Create only reusable UI components in this folder
2. Keep components modular and focused on a single responsibility
3. Follow consistent naming conventions: `ComponentName.js`
4. Include proper component documentation
5. Avoid placing business logic here

## Structure

```
components/
    ├── common/        # Shared UI elements
    ├── screens/       # Screen-specific components
    └── layouts/       # Layout components
```

Note: Ensure all components are properly exported and documented.
